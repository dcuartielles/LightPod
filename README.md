# LightPod

A series of examples on how to build a light pod using Arduino MKR1010 and MKR1000 to make nice looking interactive lamps.

## List of Examples

The examples increase in complexity step by step, you can go straight for examples 7 and 8 if you feel funky or start from the first one and follow my stream of consciousness while producing this code.

* _01_simple_test
* _02_sync_rings
* _03_opposed_rings
* _04_simple_clock_test
* _05_breathing
* _06_data_arrival
* _07_ambient_display
* _07_ambient_display_FAKEEVENTS (the John Malkovich example)
* _08_ambient_display_MQTT

## Documentation

* The pod was featured at Bar Arduino 20200623: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgB2v2LSGig (min 31:45 and on)

## Licence

Check out the code, everything is in the code ... follow the code.

## The Maker Disclaimer

Remember, I made this code in less than 7 hours, there might be bugs here and there. I do take pull requests ;-)

The pod was built in about * minutes.
